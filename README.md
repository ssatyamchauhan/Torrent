## Torrents wow it is a beautiful question so letâ€™s find how these torrents works.

I want to simplify this in easy way so that you can easily understand this :

> When you are visiting a website your browser sends requests to the website ip address that you want to connect to asking to provide the requested page of the website, the server of the website then checks for what the user requested for and sends the data which requested by the user.Your browser download the data from web server and displays graphically to user to access the data (music,videos,pdf,..etc)

_Note: Any website you are visiting firstly it download the data from the web server and provide it to user._

*web Server is a centralized data.*
*Torrents* : It is peer to peer protocol which means that when a device use this protocol can communicate with each other without using the centralized server.(It means that it is just opposite to web server).

    * 1.Whenever you download the torrent we first download the torrent file (estimate size:1 to 3kb)and open with torrent client like utorrent,bit-torrent. The torrent file that    you downloaded is Metadata (is a data about data. It contains infrmation about file size, structure,trackers addresses )

    * 2.A Tracker is basically a server that contains the record of all the computers that already have the file that you are trying to download.

*Seeder*: The computer or mobile you are downloading your data from the computers that already have the same data that you are downloading.

## How torrents works?

    *Client connects to the tracker and finds all the computers that have the file you are trying to download.
    *Your utorrent client will then able to download the packets of data from different seeders. It doesnâ€™t download the whole data from one seeder if they have multiple seeders through small small packets of data and this packets of data merged by utorrent.

*Leecher*: The one who download the file from the seeders.

This whole combination of seeders and leechers is called a torrent swamp.Any file is offered by our torrents will have its own torrent swamp.

## Why torrents are speed than normal downloading through browser?

Markup : * Because file is downloaded from different computers so that downloading speed of seeders increases then file will be downloaded soon.

    * After downloading the file you will become a seeder then starts uploading the some packet of data which is requested by the leecher.

    * you can stop uploading the data by turn off by clicking stop the torrent file after downloading but you should not do that because 
    torrents works on seeders so that leechers can download it.

## The working of torrent can be simply explained by stating the difference between normal download and torrent download.

*Torrent is a beautiful peer to peer in data sharing .So please donâ€™t stop seeding because only some amount of data is being uploaded.*
